 * As per the documentation at
 * https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-autowired-annotation
 * : Only one annotated constructor per class can be marked as required, but
 * multiple non-required constructors can be annotated. In that case, each is
 * considered among the candidates and Spring uses the greediest constructor
 * whose dependencies can be satisfied â€” that is, the constructor that has the
 * largest number of arguments. The constructor resolution algorithm is the same
 * as for non-annotated classes with overloaded constructors, just narrowing the
 * candidates to annotated constructors.
 * 
 * But I find this to be untrue.
